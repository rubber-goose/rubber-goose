- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rubber-goose

Yo, yo, yo, it's the G-double-O-S-E,  
Livin' in the pond, that's where I be.  
From the pond hood, where the water's fine,  
Duckin' and divin', it's a goose's prime time.  

Waddlin' with my crew, feathers flyin' high,  
Splish-splashin' in the water, reachin' for the sky.  
Pond life ain't easy, but I keep it cool,  
Chillin' with my homies, breakin' all the rules.
