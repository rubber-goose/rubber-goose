ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rubber-goose
  
Yo, listen up, it's the G-double-O-S-E,  
Honkin' loud in the pond, that's where I be.  
From the pond hood, where the water's fine,  
Duckin' and divin', honkin' all the time.

Waddlin' with my crew, feathers flyin' high,  
Honk, honk, honkin' in the water, reachin' for the sky.  
Pond life ain't easy, but I keep it cool,  
Chillin' with my homies, honkin' like a fool.
